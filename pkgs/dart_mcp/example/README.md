# Simple Client and Server

See `bin/simple_client.dart` and `bin/simple_server.dart` for a basic example of
how to use the `MCPClient` and `MCPServer` classes. These don't use any LLM to
invoke tools.

# Full Features Examples

See https://github.com/dart-lang/ai/tree/main/mcp_examples for some more full
featured examples using gemini to automatically invoke tools.

The example client there is also useful for testing your own server.
